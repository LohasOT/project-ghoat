### Name

DATE NIGHT

### Description

Date night is the name of our application that takes three api's; some being totally random (movie) and the other is based on user input for food recipes based on user entry (ingredient).

We built the app so that anyone can plan their date night of a random meal based on a main ingredient they own and a random movie to watch with the meal.

To get started, just input the main ingredient of a dish that you would like to use and you will be presented with a delicious recipe. A random movie with info related to the film is presented side by side next to the dish.

If you do not like the recipe or random movie presented, you can re-search the ingredient to get another random recipe or movie. Once you are satisfied with the pairing, you can save the pair to favorites where you can store in a list all your previous favorite Date Night ideas.

You are able to view your saved pairing in the 'MY RESULTS' tab, which will show all of your saved entries via local storage.

The about us page is a description of those involved in creating the project with a short bio about each member and a link to their socials.
